Developed a full-stack-ready backend for an event management platform enabling seamless event discovery, booking, and user management. Built using Java Spring Boot with a structured MVC architecture, the application provides secure, scalable, and RESTful APIs for core functionalities:

Event Management – Create, update, view, and categorize events via /api/events endpoints, with filtering by category and ID.

Booking System – End-to-end booking lifecycle including booking creation, listing all bookings, and deletion through /api/bookings endpoints.

User Management – Add, retrieve, and delete users via /api/users, supporting attendee records and role-based access design.

Service Layer Architecture – Controllers delegate logic to dedicated services, ensuring clean separation of concerns and easy maintainability.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) – Enabled for integration with a separate front-end client.

Scalable Design – Maven-based build and dependency management, ready for containerization and deployment.
